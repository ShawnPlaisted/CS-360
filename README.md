CS 360

## About This Project  
This repository contains my completed work for CS 360: Mobile Architecture and Programming. The artifact I chose is my final project, the **WeightTracker app**, which represents my ability to design, build, and test a complete mobile application. This project demonstrates user-centered design, modular coding practices, and the integration of features like login, data storage, and SMS notifications.  

## Project Overview  
The WeightTracker app gives users a simple way to track their weight each day, set a personal goal, and stay motivated as they progress. The main purpose of the app is to make daily tracking fast, easy, and rewarding while protecting user privacy and keeping the design professional.  

## Screens and Features  
The app included several key features:  
- **Login and Registration** to allow users to create an account and store data securely  
- **Daily Weight Tracking** with quick data entry and stored history to view progress  
- **Goal Notifications and SMS Alerts** to notify users when they reach their target weight  

The user interface was designed with simplicity in mind, using clear navigation, large touch targets, and minimal clutter so users can log entries in just a few seconds.  

## Coding Approach  
I used a modular approach, separating database operations, SMS functionality, and UI components into different classes. This made the app easier to maintain and test. I also included input validation and error handling so the app could handle invalid data and edge cases without crashing. These coding practices are strategies I plan to continue using in future projects.  

## Testing and Validation  
I tested the app in the Android emulator across multiple Android versions to make sure it worked consistently. I validated login, registration, data entry, and SMS notifications. I also tested edge cases like incorrect input or rapid button presses. Testing was important because it revealed small usability issues I was able to fix before finalizing the app.  

## Overcoming Challenges  
One challenge I faced was balancing SMS permissions with user privacy. I solved this by requesting only the minimum permissions and including fallback notifications when SMS was unavailable. Another challenge was designing the database structure in a way that supported basic tracking now but could expand later for features like progress charts.  

## Strengths and Successes  
The part of the app I am most proud of is how the goal notifications and database features worked together. The app not only functions as intended but was built in a way that is reliable, user-friendly, and adaptable for future improvements. This project demonstrates my ability to design and develop a complete mobile application with both the user and long-term maintainability in mind.
